## About The Project

Here's a video demonstrating the Blackjack Simulator in action:

</p>


Welcome to our Python-based Blackjack (21) game! This project is designed to bring the classic card game Blackjack to life in an engaging and interactive way. In Blackjack, the goal is to beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 without going over. This project, developed in Python, adheres to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and offers a user-friendly console interface for easy gameplay. It simulates standard Blackjack rules and gameplay, allowing players to place bets, draw cards, and calculate winnings. It keeps track of player and dealer cards, hand values, and determines the winner. Feel free to explore the code and enjoy playing Blackjack!

## Roadmap

- [ ] Python Installation: Make sure you have the latest Python version installed for project development.
- [ ] Project Setup: Set up your project environment, and consider using a development platform like Replit for ease of development.
- [ ] Understanding OOP: Get acquainted with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, as they are fundamental to this project. You can refer to resources like [Wikipedia's OOP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) or [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp) to learn OOP in Python.
- [ ] Feature 1: Begin by implementing the core functionality of the Blackjack game, including player interactions and card handling.
- [ ] Feature 2: Enhance the game by adding more features such as betting, scoring, and different playing strategies.
- [ ] Feature 3: Implement advanced game mechanics like splitting, doubling down, and insurance.
    - [ ] Sub-Feature: Develop a feature for users to view their game statistics and history.

You can also check out the [open issues](https://github.com/senabibi/Blackjack/issues) for a full list of proposed features and known issues.

This roadmap provides a step-by-step plan for the development of your Blackjack project, covering everything from essential setup to advanced gameplay features.
